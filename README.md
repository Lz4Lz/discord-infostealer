I wrote this a while back, very bad and messy code. But works, might update or add functionality in the future i guess. This also bypasses Windows Defender.

Information gets sent to a webhook of your choice in the sock.c file. Edit some stuff to your liking, as i wrote before, the code is pretty messy. You can make it into a DLL or exe, whatever you need.

Example info sent to the webhook or server of your choice:

Token: ...
Phone: ...
Name: ...
Email: ...
